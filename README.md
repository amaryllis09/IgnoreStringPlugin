# IgnoreStringPlugin
Last tested version: Minecraft 1.12

A Spigot plugin allowing players to ignore individual strings. Players who ignore strings will simply not see chat messages with the string. 

Drag into plugin folder. Ignored strings will automatically serialize into ignorestring.data !

Usage:
/ignorestring <stringToIgnore> : Adds a string to the player's ignore list.
/clearignoredstrings : Clears all of the player's ignored strings

Please leave any issues with the plugin in issues.
Also, if you use this plugin for your server please message me via Reddit /u/Amaryllis9 - I haven't tested this with large numbers of people and I'd like to see it in action.
